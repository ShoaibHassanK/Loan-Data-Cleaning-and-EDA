# Loan-Data-Cleaning-and-EDA
This repository contains SQL scripts for cleaning and conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a loan dataset. Explore data cleaning techniques and gain insights into loan-related trends and patterns.

# Loan Data Cleaning and EDA

In this portfolio project, I work with three key tables, each serving a distinct purpose. The project revolves around data cleaning and exploration, ensuring data quality and suitability for further analysis.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Cleaning:** I eliminate unnecessary columns, replace unwanted characters, and fill missing values, ensuring data accuracy and integrity.
  
- **SQL Functions:** I leverage SQL functions like `REPLACE`, `LEN`, and `SUBSTRING` to manipulate data efficiently.

- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs):** I structure data for analysis using CTEs, enhancing query performance and readability.

- **Data Exploration:** I perform exploratory data analysis, revealing insights into loan delivery methods, yearly summaries, top lenders, industries, loan forgiveness percentages, and more.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available from the [Small Business Administration (SBA)](https://data.sba.gov/dataset/ppp-foia).

For recruiters and potential collaborators, this project showcases my strong SQL skills, ability to clean and transform data effectively, and proficiency in conducting data analysis to derive valuable insights. Feel free to explore the scripts and results to gain an understanding of my capabilities.
